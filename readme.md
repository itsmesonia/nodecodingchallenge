# Node.js File Upload API Challenge

## 📌 Overview

This project is a Node.js/Express API built for a coding challenge.  
It allows uploading a **CSV file of user data** (`name, email`) and performs **asynchronous email validation** for each record.

The API simulates calling an external email validation service, limits concurrent requests, and provides a **status tracking endpoint** so you can check progress after upload.

The project also includes:

- ✅ **Rate limiting** on the upload endpoint
- ✅ **CSV streaming parser** (handles large files efficiently)
- ✅ **Concurrency control** (`p-limit`, max 5 validations at once)
- ✅ **Detailed JSON response** (processed vs failed records)
- ✅ **Logging** with Winston
- ✅ **Error handling** (invalid files, timeouts, unexpected errors)
- ✅ **Unit tests** with Jest & Supertest

**POST** `/upload`

- Accepts a `.csv` file with columns: `name,email`
- Returns an `uploadId` to track progress
