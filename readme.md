# Node.js File Upload API Challenge

## üìå Overview

This project is a Node.js/Express API built for a coding challenge.  
It allows uploading a **CSV file of user data** (`name, email`) and performs **asynchronous email validation** for each record.

The API simulates calling an external email validation service, limits concurrent requests, and provides a **status tracking endpoint** so you can check progress after upload.

The project also includes:

- ‚úÖ **Rate limiting** on the upload endpoint
- ‚úÖ **CSV streaming parser** (handles large files efficiently)
- ‚úÖ **Concurrency control** (`p-limit`, max 5 validations at once)
- ‚úÖ **Detailed JSON response** (processed vs failed records)
- ‚úÖ **Logging** with Winston
- ‚úÖ **Error handling** (invalid files, timeouts, unexpected errors)
- ‚úÖ **Unit tests** with Jest & Supertest

## üöÄ API Endpoints

### 1. Upload File

**POST** `/upload`

- Accepts a `.csv` file with columns: `name,email`
- Returns an `uploadId` to track progress

1Ô∏è‚É£ Upload a file (POST)

Method: POST

URL: http://localhost:3000/upload

Body ‚Üí form-data

Key: file (type = File)

Value: pick a CSV file (e.g. your sample.csv)

üëâ Response should look like:

```
{
"uploadId": "a7f6c8c9-9c7e-4c1a-8d83-57a29c24f6b2",
"message": "File uploaded successfully. Processing started."
}
```

**Example request (PowerShell):**

### 2. Check Status

**GET** `/status/:uploadId`

- Returns the current progress of the upload, or the final results once processing is complete.
- If the `uploadId` is invalid, returns a `404`.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Check status (GET)

Method: GET

URL:

http://localhost:3000/upload/<uploadId>

Replace <uploadId> with the one you just got back from a post request.

Example:

http://localhost:3000/upload/f8a056e2-9c61-46d7-8a5c-fea24f563e02

üëâ Response should look like:

```
{
    "uploadId": "f8a056e2-9c61-46d7-8a5c-fea24f563e02",
    "totalRecords": 10,
    "processedRecords": 7,
    "failedRecords": 3,
    "details": [
        {
            "name": "Jane Smith",
            "email": "invalid-email",
            "error": "Invalid email format"
        },
        {
            "name": "Charlie Adams",
            "email": "charlie_at_domain.com",
            "error": "Invalid email format"
        },
        {
            "name": "Emily White",
            "email": "emily_at_work.com",
            "error": "Invalid email format"
        }
    ]
}
```

# üß™ Testing

This project uses Jest as the test runner, and Supertest for API integration testing.

### Unit Tests

The challenge required unit tests for:

CSV File Parsing

We directly test the parseCSV utility to ensure rows are correctly streamed and parsed from the sample CSV file.

Async Email Validation

We test the mockValidateEmail service with valid and invalid emails to confirm asynchronous validation works as expected.

Error Handling

We test API responses for missing files (400 Bad Request) and invalid upload IDs (404 Not Found).

# Integration Tests

For the Express API endpoints:

``` POST /upload```

Verified behavior when no file is uploaded.

Verified uploading a valid CSV returns a unique uploadId.

```GET /upload/:uploadId```

Verified unknown IDs return 404 Not Found.

Verified status endpoint returns processing progress and results.

# Running Tests

To run the full suite:

```npm test```


# Run a single test file:

```
npm test tests/parser.test.js
npm test tests/validator.test.js
npm test tests/upload.test.js
```
